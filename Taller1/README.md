# Workshop N° 1 Support Vector Machines (SVM)


In this workshop, a support vector machine is implemented in order to solve two binary classification problems.

The first problem is the classification of banknotes, given a vector of image features, to determine whether the banknote is real or fake.

The second problem is the classification of office occupancy given a vector of features related to the office environment.


## Libraries used
The following libraries are used in this notebook:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn`  for building the SVM model and splitting the dataset

## Installation
you can install them using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```

## How to run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells in the notebook in sequence.
